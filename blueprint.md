# Lotto Number Simulator

## Overview

A simple web application that simulates the generation of lottery numbers. Users can click a button to generate a set of unique random numbers, which are then displayed in a visually appealing way.

## Project Outline

*   **Color Palette:** A modern and vibrant color scheme. Using CSS variables for maintainability.
*   **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts.
*   **Visual Effects:**
    *   Subtle background texture.
    *   "Lifted" cards for the numbers with soft drop shadows.
    *   A "glow" effect on the interactive button.
    *   Animations for the numbers appearing.
*   **Responsiveness:** The layout will be responsive and work on mobile devices.
